# Mission Control

A macOS-style workspace overview for [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org), as a shell plugin.

Based on [AndyWeiBoan/omarchy-mission-control](https://github.com/AndyWeiBoan/omarchy-mission-control).
This version adds a touchpad swipe that follows your fingers, and a smoother,
GPU-transformed animation.

![Mission Control showing six desktop thumbnails across the top and the current desktop's window shrunk out beneath them](preview.png)

A strip of live desktop thumbnails across the top, and underneath it the current
desktop's windows shrunk out so none overlaps, each with its app icon and title.
Click a window to jump to it, click a desktop to switch to it.

The open is two-phase, and that is the whole point: the surface goes up with
every window drawn at its real size and position — pixel-for-pixel the desktop
you were already looking at — and only then do the windows shrink into place. So
your desktop appears to shrink, rather than a different-looking screen fading in
over it.

The thumbnails are live, including windows on workspaces you cannot currently
see.

## Install

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/henriSchulz/omarchy-mission-control --enable
```

Then bind a key — plugins cannot bind keys themselves. In `~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua`:

```lua
o.bind("CTRL + UP", "Mission Control",
  "omarchy-shell shell toggle henri.missioncontrol '{}'")

-- Optional: a dedicated exit, so CTRL+UP is never an accidental re-open.
o.bind("CTRL + DOWN", "Close Mission Control",
  "omarchy-shell shell hide henri.missioncontrol")
```

For the legacy (non-Lua) Hyprland config format, see [`install/bindings.conf`](install/bindings.conf).

Touchpad gestures are optional and live in [`install/gestures.lua`](install/gestures.lua).
The overview tracks a four-finger vertical swipe live: the windows shrink as your
fingers move, and on release it settles open or closed by distance and speed.
A four-finger sideways swipe inside the overview slides between desktops, the
next one coming in beside the current one; outside it stays Hyprland's normal
workspace swipe.
Needs Hyprland 0.56+ (gesture callback tables). Log out and back in after adding it.
Edits to the plugin need `omarchy restart shell`: the shell's hot reload does not
re-create this always-loaded overlay.

For a smooth open, also turn off Hyprland's own layer fade for this surface:

```lua
hl.layer_rule({ match = { namespace = "mission-control" }, no_anim = true, animation = "none" })
```

## Removal

```bash
omarchy plugin disable henri.missioncontrol
omarchy plugin remove  henri.missioncontrol
```

Then delete the two binds you added to `bindings.lua`, and the gestures from
`input.lua` if you added those.

The plugin writes nothing outside its own folder — no config files, no state, no
autostart entries, nothing in `~/.local`. Removing it leaves nothing behind, and
disabling it is enough to stop it being mounted. The keybindings are the only
thing it asks you to change, and you make that change yourself.

## Keys

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `←` `→` | Walk the Spaces strip — switches desktop **without** closing, so you can look before you leap |
| `↑` `↓` | Move between the windows of the current desktop |
| `Tab` | Cycle windows |
| `1`–`9` | Jump straight to that desktop |
| `Enter` | Open the selected window |
| `Esc`, click the backdrop | Close |
| `CTRL`+`↓` / `CTRL`+`↑` | Close (mirrors whatever opened it) |

Clicking a desktop thumbnail switches to it and closes. Clicking a window
focuses it and closes.

Drag a desktop thumbnail along the strip to reorder the desktops; the others
slide aside to make room. The numbers stay in place and the windows move, so
`SUPER`+`n` follows the new order, and you stay on the desktop you were on.
Needs the Lua config (all moves go to Hyprland as one Lua call).

## Requirements

Nothing to install — everything it uses ships with Omarchy.

One external command: the bundled `bin/wallpaper-token` runs as a POSIX shell
and uses coreutils `readlink`/`stat`/`basename` to read file metadata about
Omarchy's `current/background` link. It prints a short cache token, never a
path; the wallpaper is always loaded through the link itself.

- Omarchy with shell plugin support (`omarchy plugin list` works)
- Hyprland — window geometry comes from its IPC, and thumbnails from
  `wlr-screencopy`
- **Persistent workspaces**, if you want the strip to be stable. Hyprland only
  creates a workspace when something lands on it, so without pinning them the
  strip grows and shrinks as you work. In `~/.config/hypr/looknfeel.lua`:

  ```lua
  hl.workspace({ id = 1, persistent = true })  -- ... and so on for 2..N
  ```

  It works without this; the strip is just less stable.

## Theming

Labels follow the shell's menu font, so `OMARCHY_MENU_FONT` is honoured and the
plugin matches the rest of Omarchy. The background is your real wallpaper, read
from Omarchy's `current/background` link, so a theme switch is picked up with no
reload.

The overview is deliberately **not** blurred — macOS does not blur the desktop
in Mission Control either; only the Spaces strip along the top is a frosted
band.

Earlier versions of this file warned against adding a compositor `blur = true`
layer rule for the `mission-control` namespace, on the grounds that it set
hyprbars' title bars flickering. That was wrong. The flicker is
[hyprwm/hyprland-plugins#697](https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprland-plugins/issues/697):
Hyprland's blurred-texture path leaves `glStencilMask` at `0x00`, so hyprbars'
rounded-corner mask silently writes nothing and the bar is tested against the
previous surface's discard mask. It has nothing to do with this plugin, and a
blur rule here is harmless.

## Why not hyprexpo

hyprexpo does a similar job inside the compositor, but it is a render pass, not
a client: it clears the whole monitor to `bg_col` every frame, so a transparent
`bg_col` still paints black and nothing shows through from underneath, and
`wallpaper_bg = 1` draws Hyprland's *built-in* wallpaper, which Omarchy does not
use. Owning a surface is the only way to get the real desktop behind the
overview.

Both were measured rather than assumed — see [docs/FINDINGS.md](docs/FINDINGS.md).

## Performance

The plugin declares `keepLoaded: true`, so the shell mounts it at startup and it
stays mounted, hidden, until summoned. That is not an optimisation detail, it is
the difference between usable and not: a standalone predecessor launched a
Quickshell process per keypress and took ~340ms before anything appeared —
~145ms of Qt/QML startup plus ~190ms decoding a 5120×2880 wallpaper, neither
avoidable per launch. Mounted once, `summon` to mapped surface measures 37–48ms
on this machine.

Window captures run only while the overview is shown, so a mounted-but-hidden
plugin costs nothing beyond the decoded wallpaper it is holding.
